#Fast Connect 3 Credential Insertion API for Citrix Receiver for Windows

The Fast Connect 3 Credential Insertion API provides an interface that
supplies user credentials to the single sign-on (SSO) feature of Citrix
Receiver for Windows 4.2 and later. Using this API, Citrix partners

can provide authentication and SSO products that use StoreFront or the
Web Interface to log users on to virtual applications or desktops and
then disconnect users from those sessions.

The system requirements and prerequisites for the API are the same as
those for Receiver. Note that XenDesktop 7 does not support the Web
Interface.

The Fast Connect 2 API is still available, but can be used only with
Receiver for Windows 3.4.
